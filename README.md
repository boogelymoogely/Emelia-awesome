# Emelia-awesome
My Awesomewm config.
It's based on the Arcolinux config (https://github.com/arcolinux/arcolinux-awesome) but with some modifications and scripts to suit my needs.
Feel free to copy it, but don't just go and use it with no modifications, unless you use Linux exactly like I do, configure it to your liking.
If you don't have multiple monitors or you don't wish to only use one HDMI monitor, you'll probably want to delete displayfix.sh and the command to run it in rc.lua. Otherwise, this is just what I feel comfortable and enjoy using, have fun. :)

Also, yes, I do use the Gnome terminal. Shame me if you want, I like it.

To install it, all you need to do is extract the files into your awesome directory. 
For me, that would be /home/emelia/.config/awesome. It'll be different if you have a different username, which is highly likely, just change it accordingly. If you don'ot have the "awesome" directory created, no problem, just make one then copy the files into it and edit as needed.
